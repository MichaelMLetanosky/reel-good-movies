## Usage

**User Story**

As the user I want to organize and curate the movies I have watched and want to watch. I also want to write reviews so I can steer my followers away from bad movies such as Epic Movie and towards good movies like Shrek 2 & Logan. Because I know Reel Good Movies.

The Application In All It's Glorious Purpose...
